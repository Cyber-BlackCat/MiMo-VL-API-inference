# MiMo-VL-7B-RL Quick API Script Guide

The `MiMoVLM-api_server.py` script in this project is designed for rapid deployment and invocation of Xiaomi's open-source multi-modal Vision-Language Model (VLM) â€” **MiMo-VL-7B-RL**. It supports image captioning and other multi-modal reasoning tasks.

## Model Overview

MiMo-VL-7B-RL is a high-performance vision-language model released by Xiaomi's large model team. It features powerful image understanding, reasoning, and multi-modal dialogue capabilities. The model utilizes a native-resolution ViT encoder, MLP projector, and MiMo-7B language model, and is optimized through multi-stage pre-training and mixed reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on several public benchmarks.

- **Model Weights Download**: [ModelScope Download Link](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL-7B-RL/files)

## Main Features

- Supports image captioning via image URL or local file upload
- Customizable prompt (instruction) support
- Standard RESTful API interface for easy integration
- Automatic management of temporary files, suitable for high concurrency

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare Model Weights**
   - Download the model weights from [ModelScope Download Page](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL-7B-RL/files) and extract them to the directory specified by `MODEL_PATH` in `MiMoVLM-api_server.py` (default: `/hy-tmp/data/MiMo-VL-7B-RL`).

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the API Service**
   ```bash
   python MiMoVLM-api_server.py
   ```
   The service will listen on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` after startup.
